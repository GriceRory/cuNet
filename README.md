# cuNet
cuda based neural network


database files contain the data used to train the networks as well as data managment. (in progress)

linear_algebra file contains matrix and vector algebras relevant to simple neural networks (ready for testing I hope.)

network files contain matrix and vector data of weights and biases. (in progress)
