database files contain the data used to train the networks as well as data managment. (in progress)

linear_algebra file contains matrix and vector algebras relevant to simple neural networks (tested.)

network file contain matrix and vector data of weights and biases. (in progress)

backpropogate file contains the functions used to train a network.
