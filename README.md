# cuNet
cuda based neural network


database files contain the data used to train the networks as well as data managment. (I have not yet fully implemented file IO)

linear_algebra file contains matrix and vector algebras relevant to simple neural networks

network file contain matrix and vector data of weights and biases.

backpropogate file contains the functions used to train a network.


testAll.cu runs test of all functions.

I run this code in ubuntu 16.04 LTS using eclipse Nsight.
To do this I import the project from git using the project explorer.
